The Smart Health Care management system is a fourth year project for my Cloud Application Development module.

For this project I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS.

This project entailed hosting a web application on a cloud provider. For this I chose Heroku.

This application allows a doctor to manage all of their patients. For patients there is a CRUD functionality and for each patient there is the possibility to also CRUD appointments.
